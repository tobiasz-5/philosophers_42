// Supervise Function:

// The supervise function detects that a philosopher has died (someone_died(philos) == 1) and breaks the loop.
// The supervise function then returns.

// Thread Join:

// In make_threads_then_join, the supervisor thread (arbiter) finishes, and pthread_join(arbiter, NULL) completes successfully.
// The remaining philosopher threads are joined.

// the pthread_join function is used to ensure proper synchronization and clean termination of threads in a multi-threaded program

// Synchronization: pthread_join ensures that the calling thread (usually the main thread) waits for the specified thread to terminate. 
// This helps in synchronizing the termination of threads.

// Using pthread_join ensures that the main thread waits for the other threads to complete before it continues or terminates. 
// This prevents the main thread from terminating prematurely, which would also prematurely end the entire program, possibly leaving other threads unfinished.

// pthread_join also ensures that the resources associated with the thread (such as memory and other resources allocated by the thread) are properly cleaned up.
//  Without joining, resources might remain allocated, leading to memory leaks.

// pthread_join ensures that the main thread waits until each thread has fully completed its execution.
